## Implementation Steps

### **Backend Setup**

1. **Install Dependencies**

    ```sh
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Configure Environment**

    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in Supabase and secret keys.

3. **Run the Backend**

    ```sh
    python wsgi.py
    ```

    - The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

4. **Supabase Integration**

    - Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `.env`.
    - User and recruiter data are managed via Supabase.

5. **CORS Configuration**

    - CORS is enabled for frontend origins in `app/__init__.py`.

6. **API Endpoints**

### **Frontend Setup**

1. **Install Dependencies**

    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. **Configure Environment**

    - Create `.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to backend URL.

3. **Run the Frontend**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **API Integration**

    - API calls use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for backend communication.
    - Utility functions in `utils/` handle data fetching and authentication.

5. **Internationalization**

    - Locale files in `locales/` and `public/locales/`.
    - Language switcher component for runtime language change.

6. **UI Components**
    - Modular components for authentication, listings, recruiter tools, resume analysis, and voice input.

---

### **Testing & Deployment**

-   Backend: Run test scripts in `backend/` to verify connections and multilingual features.
-   Frontend: Manual testing via browser; add tests as needed.
-   Deploy backend (e.g., Render, Railway) and frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
-   Update environment variables for production URLs and keys.

---

## Notes

-   Keep all secrets and API keys out of version control.
-   Extend language support by adding new locale files and updating translation logic.
-   For additional features (e.g., more AI models, analytics), follow the modular structure in both backend and frontend.
